## SchiffeVersenken
Online Java Version of Schiffe Versenken


**How to Start:**
To start the Server, double click ServerV2.jar. The Server does not have a interface yet, so you might think nothing happend.

After you have started the Server you can play now with max. 2 Person on each Server yet. To do so, double click the SchiffeVersenkenLauncher.jar. The ip Adress is the ip from your server (when you run the server on the same device you can use "localhost" as ip) and the port is 8000.

_Bugs: When you start shooting while your oponent has not committed his ships to the server, the whole thing crashes. Will be fixed soon._


The Code is fully written in Java and available in /testLayout (Launcher) and /Server
